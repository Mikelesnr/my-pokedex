# Overview

Overview
This project is a Pokedex web application that allows users to search for Pokémon and view detailed information about each one. The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and to implement features such as API integration and dynamic content rendering.

To start a test server on your computer, run the following command in your terminal:

npm run dev

Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the first page of the app.

if you download the repository use "npm install" before you run the dev server 

the applicatio uses an online database so it will be fully functional upon dowloading.
